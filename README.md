# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
This web-based CPU Scheduling Simulator allows users to understand and visualize key operating systems concepts. Users can input process arrival times and burst times, select a scheduling algorithm, and see the resulting Gantt chart along with average waiting and turnaround times.

This project demonstrates:

Operating system scheduling algorithms

Algorithmic correctness

Visualization of low-level process scheduling concepts

It’s an ideal project for Computer Engineering students looking to showcase strong OS and frontend skills on GitHub.

Features

Input number of processes and their arrival & burst times

Choose scheduling algorithm:

FCFS (First Come First Serve)

SJF (Shortest Job First)

Round Robin (with user-defined quantum)

Display Gantt chart (div-based visualization)

Show average waiting time and turnaround time

Interactive and educational
